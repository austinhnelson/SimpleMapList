# Simple Map List App

### Project Description
A program that displays a map with the options to: add, remove, load, save or get a location. Specifically, this app is designed for mobile use only and will not work on the web due to the dependencies. The add option will pull up a popout where you can enter in a location and the API will attempt to resolve the address to a location and display it for you. The remove option will remove the selected location from the list. The load will append a remote list to the current list. The save option will save the current list as the list to load for the "load" option. Finally, the current button gets the device's current location and adds it to the list. Only the city that the device is in will be displayed in the list, not the full address (as designed).


### Reflection
This was a really REALLY cool project! It highlighted the true capabilities that the React framework is possible for, which is a lot! We used an API that someone else built that handled a ton of the hard work for us, which is super nice. This wasn't exactly a strenuous project, which is important to note because that demonstrates how nice working with a framework like this is. In addition, I thought developing apps for mobile would be a lot more work and needed to care about dimensions more than we did in this project. React handles so much for you that even working with mobile apps, there aren't a lot of extra things you need to think about. The biggest one was the portrait vs landscape and how the views will be different. Which was a matter of checking the width vs the height and setting a list to a different property. Overall, I really enjoyed this project and I am looking forward to the camera assignment.
